# Workshop Plan: Vibecoding for Ecologists

## Schedule (4 hours)

### Hour 1: Setup & Foundations (60 min)
- **0:00-0:15** — Welcome & what is vibecoding? (lecture/demo)
  - Show a live demo: go from idea → working app in 10 minutes
  - Explain the shift: describing what you want vs. writing syntax
- **0:15-0:30** — Tool setup & accounts
  - Ensure everyone has access to their AI coding tool
  - Verify deployment platform accounts (Vercel, Netlify, or Streamlit Cloud)
- **0:30-0:45** — Choose your dataset & define your project
  - Browse available datasets
  - Sketch out what their app will do (1-2 sentences)
  - Pair up or work solo
- **0:45-1:00** — First vibecoding exercise
  - Guided: everyone builds the same simple "Hello World" app together
  - Deploy it live — everyone sees their first app on the web

### Hour 2: Build (60 min)
- **1:00-1:10** — Quick tips for effective prompting
  - Be specific about what you want
  - Iterate in small steps
  - Ask the AI to explain what it did
  - When stuck, describe the problem, not the solution
- **1:10-2:00** — Free build time (with roaming support)
  - Participants work on their chosen projects
  - Instructors circulate to help with prompts and debugging
  - Suggested milestones:
    - [ ] Load and display your dataset
    - [ ] Add a visualization (chart, map, or table)
    - [ ] Add interactivity (filters, search, selection)

### Break (15 min)

### Hour 3: Enhance & Polish (60 min)
- **2:15-2:25** — Show & tell: quick demos of works in progress
- **2:25-3:15** — Continue building
  - Suggested milestones:
    - [ ] Add a second view or analysis
    - [ ] Improve the UI/layout
    - [ ] Add explanatory text or about page
    - [ ] Handle edge cases

### Hour 4: Deploy & Present (45 min + buffer)
- **3:15-3:35** — Deployment workshop
  - Step-by-step guided deployment
  - Troubleshoot any deployment issues
- **3:35-3:55** — Lightning presentations (2-3 min each)
  - Each participant/team shows their app
  - Share the live URL
- **3:55-4:00** — Wrap-up
  - Resources for continued learning
  - How to maintain and update your app
  - Community/support channels

## Instructor Roles
- **Lead instructor**: Demo, lectures, keep time
- **Roaming support** (2-3 people): Help individuals during build time
- **Akasa Nakha**: Available as an AI coding assistant for overflow questions

## Contingency Plans
- If someone gets stuck: have pre-built templates at checkpoints
- If deployment fails: Streamlit Cloud as backup (simplest deployment)
- If time runs short: skip polish phase, prioritize deployment
