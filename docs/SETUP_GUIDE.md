# Pre-Workshop Setup Guide

Complete these steps BEFORE the workshop to maximize build time.

## Required Accounts (free)

### 1. AI Coding Assistant (choose one)
- **Claude** (recommended): https://claude.ai — sign up for free account
- **ChatGPT**: https://chat.openai.com — free tier works
- **Cursor**: https://cursor.sh — AI-native code editor (free tier)
- **Replit**: https://replit.com — browser-based IDE with AI built in

### 2. Deployment Platform (choose one)
- **Streamlit Cloud** (easiest for Python): https://streamlit.io/cloud
  - Connect your GitHub account
  - Best for data dashboards and simple apps
- **Vercel** (best for web apps): https://vercel.com
  - Connect your GitHub account
  - One-click deploy from GitHub
- **Netlify**: https://netlify.com
  - Similar to Vercel, very beginner-friendly
- **Hugging Face Spaces** (good for ML apps): https://huggingface.co/spaces

### 3. GitHub Account
- https://github.com — sign up if you don't have one
- This is where your code will live
- Most deployment platforms connect directly to GitHub

## Recommended Stack Choices

### For Python users (R background, data-focused)
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Deploy on**: Streamlit Cloud
- **Why**: Feels like writing a script, minimal web knowledge needed

### For the adventurous (want a "real" web app)
- **Framework**: Next.js or basic HTML/JS
- **Deploy on**: Vercel or Netlify
- **Why**: More polished result, more transferable skills

### For zero coding experience
- **Tool**: Replit or Cursor
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Deploy on**: Streamlit Cloud or Replit itself
- **Why**: Everything in one place, least friction

## Pre-Workshop Checklist
- [ ] Created AI assistant account and tested a basic prompt
- [ ] Created GitHub account
- [ ] Created deployment platform account
- [ ] Connected GitHub to deployment platform
- [ ] Installed any local tools (if using Cursor: download and install)
- [ ] Browsed the dataset options (see datasets/ folder)

## Troubleshooting
If you run into issues during setup, come to the workshop 15 minutes early and we'll help you get sorted.
