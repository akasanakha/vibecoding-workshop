# Vibecoding Workshop: From Idea to Deployed App in 4 Hours

## Overview
A hands-on workshop for senior undergraduates and graduate students in ecology and related fields. Participants will use AI coding assistants to build and deploy a web application using real ecological datasets — no prior programming experience required.

## Workshop Goals
- Introduce vibecoding (AI-assisted development through natural language)
- Build a working web app from an ecological dataset
- Deploy it live on the web by end of session
- Demystify software development for scientists

## Target Audience
- Senior undergraduates and graduate students
- Background in ecology, biodiversity, conservation, bioinformatics, GIS, etc.
- No coding experience required (some may have R/Python basics)

## Duration
4 hours (with breaks)

## What Participants Leave With
- A deployed web app they built themselves
- Understanding of how to use AI for rapid prototyping
- Confidence to build tools for their own research
